# Jantarova unikatni ZOO
Also known as JZOO
translates to "Jantar's unique ZOO".
It's a internet game

## What am I supposed to do?
+ You start with $100 debt and your dead childhood dog. What to do? Sell the dog to the black market to get yourself out of the debt!
With your $2300 you now have you are now able buy animal space and some animals!
+ Your capitalist ZOO is now making you some sweet sweet **CA$HES** !!


## How does money work?
You receive dollars based on the amount of animals you own and how many space you have for your animals

+ You receive $1.7 every second for each animal you own
+ You pay $5 every second for each animal space you have
+ You can sell animals for organs after they die and no longer make you money


## Prices
+ **Space for animals:** starts at $90 and then is 1.6x the price of animal
+ **Animal:** Starts at $60 and every purchase of new animal increases that price by $1
+ You can sell dead animals


### How does animal death work exactly?
10 seconds after loading the webpage, every 30 seconds a function is called that kills 0.5% of owned animals. Those animals no longer make you money but you can sell them for some money. Just like you sold your childhood dog at the beginning.
